# Rally Cars (2003)
Rally Cars a project prototype built using HGE game engine. Interesting points is the circuit generation system.

This project started as a vacation project in 2003. I usually enjoy my vacation time investigating and implementing video game prototypes, instead of enjoying the beach or the warm weather here in Spain.

In this case I wanted to change the theme, from space arcade games, to Cars, with Physics and 2D collisions.
I wanted to try a Game Engine instead of working on my own, and I choose HGE not sure if because it was free, or easy to use or both things.
Another thing I wanted to try is another art style. Taking in consideration I would create the graphics for the game I would need something easy for me, and that's why I tried using real life pictures for the map, and also the cars.

The layout of the circuit was going to be also easy to create, and using an algorithm all the information would be gathered. The algorithm starts looking for a starting point (blue dot) and from that point on, it should start looking for segments. Segments are connected interleaved, one red and the next green, then the next red, etc ... This way the algorith knows when one segment starts and when ends.

The prototype moves with the arrow keys. You accelerate and the car can bounce off the segments.
And that's basically it : )
